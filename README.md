# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
There is war is going on between two countries. <br>
Movement by air is impossible due to detection missiles.  <br>
Moving by land is too slow and very dangerous. <br>
The submarine of one country is going under the water to another country.<br>
The enemy country has planted some mines in the ocean.<br>
The mines are explodes when some object comes in contact with it.<br>
The ocean also contains rocks.<br>
The submarine needs to predict the object that it is crossing. is it mine or rock?<br>
The submarine uses sonar signal that sends sound and receives switchbacks. <br>
This signal in the processed to detect whether the object is a mine or or a rock in the ocean.<br>
<hr><br>
My job is to help the submarine system predict whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock.<br>
This is critical for the war to be won! <br>
