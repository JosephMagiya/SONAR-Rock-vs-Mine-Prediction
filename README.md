# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
💣 There is war is going on between two countries. <br>
✈️ Movement by air is impossible due to detection missiles.  <br>
🚒 Moving by land is too slow and very dangerous. <br>
🌊 The submarine of one country is going under the water to another country.<br>
💣 The enemy country has planted some mines in the ocean.<br>
💥 The mines are explodes when some object comes in contact with it.<br>
⛰️ The ocean also contains rocks.<br>
🤔 The submarine needs to predict the object that it is crossing. is it mine or rock?<br>
🎯 The submarine uses sonar signal that sends sound and receives switchbacks. <br>
🔎 This signal in the processed to detect whether the object is a mine or or a rock in the ocean.<br>
<hr><br>
👨‍💻 My job is to help the submarine system predict whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock.<br>
❗ This is critical for the war to be won! <br>
